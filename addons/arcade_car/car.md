# Car Dynamics

## Engine

* **Rev Limit**.
* **Peak Torque**.

## Surfaces

* **Lubrication**
* **Hardness**
* **Roughness**

## Tires

* **Tire Heating**. As the car drives, the tires will naturally heat up. The process of heating is based on the energy lost to friction, meaning lots of drifting will heat up tires faster than driving normally.
